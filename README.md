## OpenCV-object-recognition-
Recurse Center project: skin recognition, edge detection etc.

This was my first project at the Recurse Center. It is more of an experimentation of how accurate OpenCV is to detect objects.

My vision was to control my mousepad with gesture recognition. This is done by tracking certain colored objects through the camera and connecting that to the mouse.
Since the color detection is a very sensitive way of tracking objects I moved onto implementing things from scratch and do the same things with a neural network.
